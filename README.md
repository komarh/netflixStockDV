I will be helping the “Netflix Stock Profile” team visualize the Netflix stock data. In finance, a stock profile is a series of studies, visualizations, and analyses that dive into different aspects of a publicly-traded company’s data.

For the purposes of the project, I will only visualize data for the year of 2017. Specifically, I will be in charge of creating the following visualizations:

- The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
- Netflix’s earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
- The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
- A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017
